<br>**Genshin Impact WishStats** is an interactive Streamlit app that visualises the probability system behind Genshin Impactâ€™s gacha mechanics. It models drop rates and pity behaviour for 4â˜… and 5â˜… characters or weapons based on theoretical probabilities and user-defined inputs. The app provides a statistical breakdown of how many wishes it may take to pull 5â˜… characters or weapons, on average.

### Why use it?
- Understand how Genshin Impact's 5â˜… and 4â˜… pity system works through simple and interactive simulations
- Visualise expected pull outcomes with data visualisations
- Estimate your odds and plan pulls based on your current 5â˜… pity and banner type
