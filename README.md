These are the web apps the site currently has:

- **5★ Probability Distributions**: Allows users to visualise comprehensive in-game drop rates as probability distributions for 5★ characters/weapons.
- **Individual 4/5★ Drop Rates Simulation**: Allows users to simulate and predict their in-game 5★ **OR** 4★ drop rates separately based on user input.
- **Combined Drop Rates Simulation**: Allows users to simulate and predict their in-game combined 3★/4★/5★ drop rates based on user input.
